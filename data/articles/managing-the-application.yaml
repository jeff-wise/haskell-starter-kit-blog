  A software project, even a humble blog, often contains of a myriad of
  components. Each component will have a set of actions that
  can be performed on it such as compiling, running tests, generating
  documentation, deploying, etc...

  Onboarding a new developer to a project, its components, and all the
  actions that the developer will need to do with those components
  should be simple. It shouldn't take a full day of another developer's
  time to walk someone though running and testing a project. That time
  should be spent on walking through the code and discussing any design
  decisions, goals, or active issues.

  Futheremore, onboarding yourself after a few weeks away from the
  project should be just as easy. If you can't remember what you ate for
  dinner two weeks ago, it's perfectly fine that you also forgot which
  exact command compiles the source code, runs the test suite, and spams
  your team Slack channel with baby elephant gifs. This
  acceptable amnesia is remedied by a clear, concise interface,
  preferably one available on the command line, clearly documented, and
  easily extensible.

  Our Haskell blog app comes with a command-line utility that
  satifies these goals perfectly. It's called `dev.hs`. After you clone
  the repository and follow the environment setup tutorial, you can run
  `./dev.hs --help`:

  ```bash
  Blog Development Commands

  Usage: dev.hs COMMAND
    Run ./dev.hs --help for a list of commands.

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text

  Available commands:
    build                    Build the [executable, docker images, ...]
    run                      Run the [docker container, executable, etc...].
    sh                       Run sh/bash in a running docker container.
    psql                     run Psql in a running docker container.
    init                     Initialize the database data.
    deploy                   Compile, build images, and run containers.
  ```

  Often, command-line utilities like `dev.hs` are 
  implemented in a shell language like Bash or an interpreted langauge like
  Python. Both are great choices, but actually, we can just use Haskell! 
  Stack allows us to write *Haskell scripts* that can be
  run on the command line as executables. We get the best of both worlds
  -- simple, self-contained scripts and the full power of Haskell.
  Futhermore, because our script is written in Haskell, it has full
  access to the types and functions in our application. We'll see later
  how this is really convenient.

  ## Getting Started

  go from zero to running project

  ## Compilation

  We can compile the web server using stack:

  ```bash
  stack build
  ```

  or with `dev.hs`:

  ```bash
  ./dev.hs build --exe
  ```

  If you want to play around with the executable, you can use stack. For
  example, `stack exec` will run the web server locally. See the
  [stack documentation](stack-docs) for more information and commands.
